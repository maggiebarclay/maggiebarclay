						<p>
							Illinois Institute of Technology’s Scarlet Space Hawks have been a
							team since 2017, and I joined my Freshman year in Fall 2018. NASA’s Robotics Mining Competition is a challenge in which
							university students must design, build, and compete with a robot that
							can excavate a mock planetary surface. Each year, teams are judged by
							their robot’s performance as well as written documentation and
							presentation. 50 teams from universities across the country attend the
							competition each May, held in the Kennedy Space Center. 
							<br><br>
							I've been involved in multiple sections of the team. I lead our Outreach team and created opportunities for team to spread STEM education to Chicago youth.
							I spent a semester as VP of Engineering, meaning the “Systems Engineer” of the team as I created technical documents keeping track of progress and goals for the team.
